Python for Data Analysis
========================

Read the excerpt of the book Python for `Data Analysis`_

It gave an introduction to using IPython, Pandas, NumPy and SciPy for Data analysis. My confidence
improved a little bit as I thought, I can use Python for doing my machine learning course.
I will setup the environment and data sets and continue with going learning the lectures.
