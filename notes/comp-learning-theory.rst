Comp Learning Theory
====================

**Haussler Theorem**

* consistent
* independent variables
* knock all high true errors.
* Bound True Error
* natural log is monotonic
* Upper bound of the version space.

**How many samples do we need to PAC learn this hypothesis set?**

.. math::

    M \ge 1/\epsilon (\ln |H| + \ln 1 / \delta)


**What did we learn?**

* What is learnable?
* Sample Complexity.
